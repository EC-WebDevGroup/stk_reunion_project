This append version replaces seperate html links with html strings that are appended to the index.html page by js functions.

Applied bootsrap form-control to registration and blog login forms.  Debugged form reloads. Logging into blog now shows previous posts, gives option to make new post and pushes new post to array.

8/3/16 Changes per meeting with Matt:
hamburger menu button for small screen
remove map
form fields for nickname, maiden name, password.
facebook link
seperate login so that its for whole page, add password
add 'who's coming' to message board as sidebar

8/5/16
Homepage now loads to just 'Registration' and 'Login' links.
Other links appear when user logs in.
Added password field to regsistration, login and data.js.
Renamed some functions & ids(all references to 'blog' are now 'message').
Deleted loadMap().
Added 'Cancel' button to message post.

There is still no validation of Regsitration fields beyond the requirement that they not be empty.  Photos page could use some work.  Needs sponsors.  Tim is looking into adding Facebook logo/link.  Whole page could probably be improved regarding layout(some centering issues) and responsiveness.  There is no logout funtion.  No hamburger button, no maiden name or nickname.
